# Challenges and Learnings :books:
The ClothingStore! app was my first attempt at using Typescript, and I gained alot of insight as to why its strongly typed nature helps with developement. The benefits I saw using Typescript was the decrease amount of debugging I had to perform, as the bugs were caught during the compiling process. In addition, the intellisense created from typing variables also made my development process a lot smoother and faster. 

### Future Features
- User Authentication
- Payment Page
